# PyBbox

Pybbox is a simple python3 library for the Bouygues BBox Routeur API.

  - This library is under development but still usable on your local network only
  - This library is made on the [Bbox Web API](https://api.bbox.fr/doc/apirouter/index.html#)
  - The tests are only made with the F@st 5330b routeur model
  - The API documentation can be found [here](https://api.bbox.fr/doc/apirouter/index.html#)

What can I add ?:
  - PR are welcome
  - Advices on library structure are welcome too, this is my first python library and I'm still a noob on Python code

### Tests

Tests are only made with a f@st 5330b routeur model. Because it's the only hardware model I own. If you have bugs with another kind of model, you could open an issue and propose some code to make the library available on all models

### TODO

 - Add test coverage
 - Add auth method to be able to use this api remotely
 - Add the library to Pypi
 - Add more get functions
 - .... and lots of things !
